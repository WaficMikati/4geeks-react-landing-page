      "description": "Chicha, modeled itself on Colombian Cumbia music but replaced the accordion with surf guitars, and incorporated the psychedelic sounds of Farfisa organs and Moog synthesizers as well as Cuban Guajira, and the pentatonic scales of Andean melodies. This is the first ever Chicha compilation released outside of Peru."

      "description": "Raised on Colombia’s Caribbean coast and united by its capital, Bogota, Ghetto Kumbé combines their musical heritage to invoke the spirit of digital rumba all over the world. The secret to their irresistible electronic ritual lies in their powerful percussion base; Caribbean house beats and Afro-Colombian rhythms inherited from West Africa."

      "description": "Celebrating early 70s Peruvian music cumbia and funk with Andean melodies, Cuban son, and heady swirls of surf guitar, farfisa organ and moog synth. They push their music way beyond mere pastiche and into strange, sun-blanched epiphanies with elegant homages that take a sublime twist of the new, re-interpreting chicha and pop classics."

      "description": "We always had a few shots before performing. Our local cachaça had loosened the bodies and minds of everyone in the room, people started to pair off and twirl around to the sound of forró music, smiling and sliding their feet off the floor - a reflex picked up from dancing in rural villages to avoid kicking up the dust."

      "description": "The songs were recorded in an improvised studio set up by Maga Bo in the Memorial Severina Paraíso da Silva - Mãe Biu, in the terreiro of Xambá in Olinda. The intention was to bring Grupo Bongar into a familiar atmosphere where Guitinho could compose music and lyrics on the spot, inspired by the history of the Xambá community."

      "description": "The siku is a wind instrument of Andean origin, symbolic in ancestral rituals, made up of two separate, complementary parts, the arca and the ira. It is a representation of duality, an essential element of the indigenous view of involvement and complementarity, far from the binary thinking typical of western societies."

      "description": "Cenotes marries his influence of Dub, IDM and Electronic vibes with the rhythms, traditions and melodies of Latin American & Andean folk and the organic sound of waterfalls, birdsongs and crackling leaves, resulting in a dreamy, deep, melodic journey that entrances as much through headphones as it does on the dancefloor."

Rebels of their time with a deep insight into the streets of Lebanon, this was sadly their last album, as Joseph Sakr would pass away shortly after its release. A memento of their unified genius and creativity."

The lyrics reflect upon themes of opression and imprisonment on a socio-politcal level, abstracted through poetry. Their latest album \">1 Greater Than One\" is a mesemerizing experience."
