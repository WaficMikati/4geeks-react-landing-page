# React Landing Page
I definitely went a little overboard in this case, as the goal was to make a basic landing page, and I ended up creating a complete one-pager with two languages and a type of instant translation to have all the website content stored in JSONs.

It was a lot of fun working on this in React, and I enjoyed refining my design until it was completely modular and scalable.

I hope you find some music in my selection that you fall in love with as much as I did.
